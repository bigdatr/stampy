# Stampy

The new and improved stampy.

## Hello there please re-write this or something

When adding new components they must have:
- Full test coverage (using ava)
- Jsdoc documentation
- Flow types
- Strict semver versioning

## To do:
- Run babel and jsdoc on build
- Run tests including flow type checking to get a passing build
- Replace jsdoc minami theme with [jsdonk](https://github.com/dxinteractive/jsdonk) when that's ready to use
- Set the `docs/` dir to output to [this github page](https://bigdatr.github.io/stampy)
